        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
          Coronavirus disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with
          symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty
          breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently,
          avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3
          feet) with people who are unwell.
        </p>
        <h5>How it spreads</h5>
        <p>
          Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected
          person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person
          touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches
          their eyes, nose, or mouth.
        </p>
