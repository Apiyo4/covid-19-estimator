            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Coronavirus disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with
              symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases,
              difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your
              hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close
              contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
            </p>

            <h3>How it spreads</h3>
            <p>
              Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an
              infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a
              person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then
              touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
